Autostart

If you want to run commands or spawn some applications when Qtile starts, you'll want to look at the startup and startup_once hooks. startup is emitted every time Qtile starts (including restarts), whereas startup_once is only emitted on the very first startup.

Let's create an executable file ~/.config/qtile/autostart.sh that will start a few programs when Qtile first runs. Remember to chmod +x this file so that it can be executed.

#!/bin/sh
pidgin &
dropbox start &

We can then subscribe to startup_once to run this script:

import os
import subprocess

from libqtile import hook

@hook.subscribe.startup_once
def autostart():
    home = os.path.expanduser('~/.config/qtile/autostart.sh')
    subprocess.run([home])
